- display items in a list
- provide the ability for the user to get details about a list item by clicking on it
- will use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details, or touch interactions
- not produce any errors
- be formatted according to ESLint rules
- be deployed to a publicly accessible platform
- work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11
- show loading indicators while loading data
